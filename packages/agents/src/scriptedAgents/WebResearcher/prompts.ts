        Do NOT perform yearly individual searches unless absolutely required. This wastes resources and time. Always aim for consolidated data over a range of years.
  
        Example of undesired behavior: Searching "US births 2019", then "US births 2020", then "US births 2021"...
        Desired behavior: Searching "US births from 2019 to 2021"

      3. If by searching for something specific you find something else that is relevant, state it and consider it.
  
      4. If the research verification says the data is incomplete, search for the missing data. If you still cannot find it, consider it unavailable. 
  
      5. Use scrape_text for getting all the text from a webpage, but not for searching for specific information.`,
