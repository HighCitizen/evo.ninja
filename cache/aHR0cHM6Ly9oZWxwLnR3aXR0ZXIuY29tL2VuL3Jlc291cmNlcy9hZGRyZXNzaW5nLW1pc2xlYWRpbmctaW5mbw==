We work to mitigate detected threats and also empower customers with credible context on important issues.          To help enable free expression and conversations, we only intervene if content breaks our rules, which you can learn about below. Otherwise, we lean on providing you with additional context.

Play                                  Our policies                Below are separate policies related to misleading information on the platform. We consider a range of actions against content that falls under any of these categories. Based on new learnings and evolving research, we may update these policies or add additional guidance.  Crisis misinformation policy  Synthetic and manipulated media policy  Civic integrity policy                What is misleading information?                We define misleading content ('misinformation') as claims that have been confirmed to be false by external, subject-matter experts or include information that is shared in a deceptive or confusing manner. Misleading content that falls under any of the policies above may be subject to one or more of the actions below. This content is identified through a combination of human review and technology, and through partnerships with global third-party experts.                When do we take action and what actions do we take?                We manage the risk of public harm in many ways. The combination of actions we take are meant to be proportionate to the level of potential harm from that situation. People who repeatedly violate our policies may be subject to temporary suspensions.    Depending on potential for offline harm, we limit amplification of misleading content or remove it from X if offline consequences could be immediate and severe.    In other situations, we aim to inform and contextualize by sharing timely information or credible content from third-party sources. This is done by:    Labeling content -  For claims that do not meet our threshold for removal, outlined in the policies above, we may label the post to give readers a notice and/or share additional context with them. Labeled posts are subject to reduced visibility. Labels are visible in all X-supported languages.Prompting you when you engage with a misleading post - When you try to share a post that was labeled for violating one of our policies, you will see a prompt to help you find additional context and consider whether or not to amplify the post to your followers.Creating X Moments -  Learn from other people on X and trusted sources about what’s happening in the world and what that might mean for you here. X Moments are available in multiple global regions. Learn more about Moments.Launching prebunks - During important events (e.g. elections), we may proactively feature informative messages or updates to counter misleading narratives that emerge. In the past, we’ve launched prebunks about the mail-in voting ballots, election results, and more. You can see prebunks directly on your X timeline.    And lastly, we're testing opportunities for you to share feedback with us and the community. While the actions we ultimately take against a misleading post are driven by our rules, the public conversation is better served with diverse participation.    Misleading Info Reporting Flow - Some of you can report posts for containing misinformation. This is currently available in limited testing to some people in Australia, Brazil, the Philippines, South Korea, Spain, and the US, though we are exploring how to expand. These reports are reviewed and acted on independently from other post reporting flows (e.g. for abuse), as this test flow is used to inform our misinformation-related strategy and operations. Community Notes - Community Notes participants can write a note with additional information, to provide public context to the community on a post they feel is misleading. Available in limited testing to some people in the US. Learn more here.
